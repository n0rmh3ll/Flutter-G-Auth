# Flutter Google Authentication App

A Flutter app demonstrating **Google Sign-In with Firebase Authentication** on Android.  
This project shows how to integrate Firebase Authentication, handle OAuth login, and generate a signed APK.

---

## Features

- Google Sign-In using Firebase Authentication
- Firebase setup with SHA-1 and SHA-256 certificate fingerprints
- Signed APK generation for production release
- Null safety enabled
- Kotlin Android embedding and Gradle plugins configured

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK installed (tested on Flutter 3.x+)
- Android Studio or compatible IDE
- Java JDK (for keytool and signing)
- Firebase account and project set up

---

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flutter-googleauth.git
cd flutter-googleauth
````

2. **Install dependencies**

```bash
flutter pub get
```

3. **Firebase Setup**

* Create a project on [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
* Add an Android app with your appâ€™s package name (e.g. `com.example.googleauth`)
* Generate SHA-1 and SHA-256 keys from your keystore:

```bash
keytool -list -v -keystore <path_to_keystore> -alias <key_alias>
```

* Add SHA fingerprints to Firebase Android app configuration
* Download the updated `google-services.json`
* Place `google-services.json` inside:

```
android/app/google-services.json
```

4. **Configure signing**

Add your keystore credentials in:

```
android/key.properties
```

Example:

```properties
storePassword=your_store_password
keyPassword=your_key_password
keyAlias=auth
storeFile=../app/gauth.jks
```

Update `android/app/build.gradle` to use this keystore for release builds.

---

### Running the App

Run the app on an emulator or physical device:

```bash
flutter run
```

Build a release APK:

```bash
flutter build apk --release
```

---

## Troubleshooting

* **Keytool not found:** Ensure your JDK `bin` folder is in your system PATH.
* **Sign-in not working:** Verify SHA fingerprints in Firebase Console and that the latest `google-services.json` is used.
* **Build errors:** Try `flutter clean` and then `flutter pub get` before rebuilding.
* **Package errors:** Remove the `package` attribute from `AndroidManifest.xml` and set `namespace` in `build.gradle`.
